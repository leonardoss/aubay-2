# Aubay - Frontend Technical test - solution 2 with React

Application created to Frontend Technical teste of Aubay. Created based on my own React-Boilerplate (https://github.com/leonardoss/react-boilerplate)

##### Application created based on
    - React 16 
    - Webpack 4
    - Babel
    - SASS
    - ESLint
    - Jest

## How to run

##### Run local
Node - 8.9.4
##### Install dependencies
```
$ npm install
```

##### Run App
```
$ npm start
```

##### Run tests
```
$ npm tests
```

The application will be avaible on
```
http://localhost:8080
```

###  Considerations
    - Just did some snapshots tests and smoke test
    - With enzyme it's possible to test components methods


Thanks for the opportunity :)
